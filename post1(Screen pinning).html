The name of this feature is <u>SCREEN PINNING</u> ; Which directly means that you can a screen which you want to show to any of the user uses  your phone.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Pinning basically refers to fixing something over all the process going under that fixed page (screen).</u></strong><br>
<br>
for example :- Your friend wants to surf something over any surfing engine (Chrome,U C Browser or other in built Browser).<br>So you can pin that screen an he will not able to access your phone except surfing from that particular browser until and unless he knows your passwords and all.<br>
<br>
 

So all you have to just follow the steps and activate this service in  your smart phone<br>
<br>
