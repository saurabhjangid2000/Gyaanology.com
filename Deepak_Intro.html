<p class="dashed">Finally now I can say that I m a blogger...<br>

 It is great feeling which is I m not able To  Express my feeling in words..<br>

I want to leave mark on this planet .<br>I  think that your life is a story and make sure that in the ending of your story will be inspirational and you should proud on it.<br>

Here I will provide you my best service…..<br>

I m very passionate about my vision which is to bring change in our education system .<br>

It is my one and only vision and for this vision I will try my best every day.<br> It is not easy for me....<br> That’s why I made a team which helps me to complete my vision and I help them to complete their vision.<br>

Don’t confuse between my Vision , Goal & achievement.<br>

According to me I already explained you Vision.<br>

Goal means I want to complete some Target & Achievement.<br>

Achievement means completed goals and I want to experience this things. Like – sky diving , travel all world and sometime like that.<br>

Right now I am fighting with some old thinking and conservative peoples ,  everyone judge you with your score .<br> I was a rank holder person , when everyone respect you and appreciate me but I am not happy for getting this bullshit ranks .<br>

So that’s why I decide to do who I like it and my rank and my bookish knowledge who I don’t like and who will not came used in my life .<br>

<strong>Now every person judge me .</strong><br>

My relative , my teachers and who know that I was a brilliant student in study.<br>

I m not against with education . I m against this kind of person.<br>

But I will give them answer with my success and most powerful revenge is Improving yourself whatever it takes.<br>

Right now I m not weak in my studies  , I studies hard but I m intresting filed.<br>

So , now u can understood why I m here and why we make this Team.<br>

Thank you so much.<br>

Jai hind!<br>
